# freelumina

A resident plugin, written in C and Fortran, that patches a licensing gate in
its host application at runtime and removes itself cleanly on shutdown.
Nothing is written to disk. Nothing survives the process.

**Status:** Fortran port; verification covers the fixtures described below.

## What it does

The host gates an optional capability behind a single function whose entire
job is to answer one licensing question. freelumina arranges for that function to
answer yes — but only for one designated argument. Every other argument is
forwarded to the original code, and the rest of the host continues to work
unchanged. That is the point.

Mechanism, briefly:

1. On load, the plugin copies readable regions of the core module and locates
   the gate: by symbol where one exists, otherwise by following a designated
   literal into a call and corroborating the callee against the surrounding
   call graph. Ambiguous results produce a diagnostic and no patch.
2. A self-contained Fortran decoder relocates the entry instructions into a
   nearby replay buffer and places a direct branch over the entry — four
   bytes on AArch64, at least five on x86-64. Unsupported instruction forms
   produce no patch. There is no return-true-for-everything fallback.
3. On shutdown, the original bytes and page protections are restored. Replay
   allocations stay valid until process exit, so an in-flight invocation
   cannot branch into freed memory. The patch dies with the process; there
   is no persistence layer.

The patch is smaller than the commit messages that discuss it. This was not
the plan; it is a property of the target.

## Build

Requires CMake 3.24+, a C11 compiler, and GNU Fortran or LLVM Flang supporting
Fortran 2008. There is no third-party disassembler or vendor SDK dependency.
Build for the host's native architecture.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build/release --parallel
```

`make` runs those steps. The library is `freelumina.so`, `freelumina.dylib`, or
`freelumina.dll` under the build directory. The native CI matrix is in
[build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml); its presence is not a CI run record.

Compiler runtimes must be available to the host loader. Inspect `ldd` on
Linux, the PE import table on Windows, or `otool -L` on macOS before
distributing an artifact to a machine without its build toolchain.

On macOS, fresh builds prefer `gfortran` in `/opt/homebrew/bin` or
`/usr/local/bin` before searching `PATH`. An explicit `FC`,
`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER`, or CMake toolchain takes precedence. Existing build
directories retain their cached compiler selection.

If CMake selects a broken compiler from `PATH`, pass
`-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/absolute/path/to/gfortran` in a fresh build
directory. `FC=/absolute/path/to/gfortran make test` does the same for a
fresh test build.

## Install

```sh
make install
```

`make install` places the library in the host's per-user plugin directory and
creates it if needed. A different location can be given explicitly:

```sh
make install PLUGINS="/opt/freelumina/plugins"
```

Restart the host after installing. The plugin registers as a fixed, hidden
resident plugin: it wakes once at startup, does not appear in any menu, and
reports to the console.

## Compatibility

The source targets x86-64 and AArch64 on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Native
execution, compile-only checks, emulation, and corpus analysis establish
different levels of evidence; target support requires verification on that
host.

Startup and shutdown must be quiescent with respect to the patched function.
The lifecycle mutex serializes plugin operations; it does not suspend host
threads. The replay buffer carries no exception-unwind metadata. Arbitrary
hot patching, exception unwinding through replay, and unknown instruction
forms are outside the verified contract. An operating system may also reject
writable code pages; that produces a diagnostic, not an entitlement
workaround.

## Tests

```sh
make test
```

The native fixture covers installation, repeated initialization, exact
matching, non-matching forwarding, guard-page prefixes, exact byte
restoration, and repeated teardown. A separate fixture covers page
boundaries, protection restoration, conflicting ownership, and unreadable
ranges.

For independent instruction execution tests:

```sh
python3 -m venv build/test-env
build/test-env/bin/python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
cmake -S . -B build/emulation -DFL_RUNTIME_CHECKS=ON -DFL_EMULATION_TESTS=ON \
  -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$PWD/build/test-env/bin/python"
cmake --build build/emulation --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/emulation --output-on-failure
```

Figure 1 is the program insignia. Like the check it replaces, it is larger
than it needs to be, difficult to look away from, and standing in exactly
one place, reminding you what you paid for.
